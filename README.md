# cube
Generalized Rubik's Cube.

This implementation assumes that you are familiar with large Rubik's Cube notation.
Examples:
  l - turn the left face clockwise (as if you were looking at it) once (i.e. 90 degrees)
  u' - turn the up (aka top) face counterclockwise once
  r2 - turn the right face clockwise twice (i.e. 180 degrees)
  2f - turn the first two layers on the front side clockwise
  2B - turn the second layer in from the back side clockwise
  3D'2 - turn the third layer in from the down (aka bottom) side counterclockwise twice
  l u' r2 2f 2B 3D'2 - perform the actions mentioned above in sequence
